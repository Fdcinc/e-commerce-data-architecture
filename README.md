Architecting a database isn't just about creating tables; it’s about ensuring data integrity, scalability, and seamless user experiences. During this project, I focused on building a robust MongoDB schema that handles everything from complex product variants to real-time order tracking.

### 🚀 Featured Project: E-Commerce Architecture
I applied my MongoDB certification knowledge to build a production-ready schema:
* **Validation**: Implemented strict `$jsonSchema` for all 5 collections.
* **Relationships**: Managed complex `1:M` and `1:1` mappings for Orders and Payments.
* **Optimization**: Configured specialized indexes for performance.
